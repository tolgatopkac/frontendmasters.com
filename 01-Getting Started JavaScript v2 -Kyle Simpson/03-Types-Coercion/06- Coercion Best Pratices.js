// A quality JS program embraces coercions, making sure the types involved in every operation are clear

// if a feature is sometimes useful and sometimes dangerous and if there is a better option then always use the better option "The good parts, Crockford"

// useful : when the reader is focused on what's important
// dangerous : when the reader can't tell what will happen

// better: when the reader understands the code

// we shouldn't have stuff that's hard to figure out. You should avoid things that are hard to figure out
