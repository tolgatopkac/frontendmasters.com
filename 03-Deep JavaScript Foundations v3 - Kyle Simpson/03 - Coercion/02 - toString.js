// toString()

// It takes any value and gives us the representation of that value in string form. And almost every value that you can imagine has at least some kind of representation in string form.

/* 
null "null"
undefined "undefined"
true "true"
false "false"
3.14159 "3.14159"
0 "0"
-0 "0" !!!

*/
/*  toString(object):toPrimitive(string)
 aka: toString() / valueOf() */

//  if we call toString on an object remember it's going to invoke the toPrimitive with the string hint
