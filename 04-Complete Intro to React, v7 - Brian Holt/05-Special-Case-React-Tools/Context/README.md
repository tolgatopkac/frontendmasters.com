### Error Boundaries

- An error boundary basically says, containing the blast zone of a component to this component. So basically, you're gonna wrap untrusted components with an error boundary so that your errors can't bubble outside of that.
- Function components are not capable of being error boundaries. So this is one specific case where you absolutely must use a class component.
