# Flexbox Header & Navbar

    <div class="header>
	    <header>
		    <nav>
		    </nav>
	    </header>
    </div>

    <div class="footer">
    	<footer>
    	</footer>
    </div>

**Notes**
- Always display the links as block, when you were inside of a navigation bar.
- `gap:1.2em`
		-Use em Instead of rems be because i wanted to take advantage of the text size, so the gap will scale with the text size. If you use rem, that's our route relative and your gap will never scale because it's relative to the HTML tag
