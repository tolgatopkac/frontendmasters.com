#  Responsive Design 
- Defined by three characteristics 
		- Flexible grid-based layout
		- Media queries (CSS3)
		- Images that resize

- **Grid-based layout**

- **Images that resize**	
		-	Images should change size, based on screen resolution
		-	Today's solutions include `<picture>` , sizes and `srcset` part of HTML spec 
## CSS Media Queries
- Browser reports screen resolution
- Based on current width, serve a stylesheet with layout for that width
- No JavaScript involved
- PS -- media queries go beyond screen size!
		- Aspect-ratio
		- orientation
# Flexbox
- The first layout elements - but not envisioned to lay out whole web pages.
- **Excels at vertical centering and equal heights**
- Very easy to reorder boxes
Disadvantage : 
- Wasn't designed to be locked down for layouts!
- Works in 1 dimension only
Flex Container are parents
Flex Items are children
